# arko

~Discord~ without all the nonsense. Based on Matrix Protocol.

arko (/ʔaɾˈko/) is an opinionated Matrix client for people who want privacy without dealing with all the Matrix annoyances.

### Status
This is a work in progress. Things will break. Features are missing. If you are looking for a finished product, come back later. 

### Why another Matrix client?
I am for the idea of federated chat servers. I believe it's the only way to go if we want privacy. Matrix is pretty much the leading protocol with all the necessary pieces to develop a ~Discord~ like experience. 

Also, it's mostly a learning project of mine.

### Goals
- Matrix protocol under the hood
- No telemetry (it's just a client bro)
- Clean interface that stays out of your way
- Fast performance (pretty challenging with Matrix ngl)
- UX be so good that your grandma should be able to use it

### Current techstack
Go, Templ, HTMX, WebView (i am allergic to javascript)

### Getting Started
stop. it's not ready yet.

i am using LLMs (like everybody else) for this project as i value my time. i only use chat LLMs (no "agentic" ones) mostly just to generate boilerplates and some generic interfaces.
